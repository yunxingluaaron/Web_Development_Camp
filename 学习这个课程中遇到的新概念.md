# 1. html文件与.ejs文件的关系：
Sure, I'd be happy to explain the differences between .ejs and .html files in simpler terms!

Think of a website as a store, and the web pages as the different sections of the store. The `HTML files` are like the `pre-printed signs` that you see in <br>

the store that tell you what products are in each section. `These signs are fixed` and `don't change unless someone physically replaces them`.<br>

Now imagine that you want to create a store that can change its products based on the season, or based on what customers are buying.<br>

You would need something more `dynamic` than pre-printed signs. This is where .ejs files come in.<br>

The `.ejs files` are like `blank signs` that can be customized to `show different information` depending on the situation.<br>

For example, let's say you have a clothing store, and you want to display different products on your homepage depending on whether it's summer or winter.<br>

With .ejs files, you can write code that checks the current season and displays different products accordingly.<br>

This is known as `server-side rendering`, and *it allows you to create a more dynamic and personalized experience for your customers.*<br>

In summary:

`HTML files are like pre-printed signs that don't change, <br>`

`while .ejs files are like blank signs that can be customized to show different information depending on the situation. <br>`

`.ejs files are used for server-side rendering, which allows you to create more dynamic and personalized websites.<br>`

# 2. 什么是Server Side Rendering：

For example, let's say you're browsing an e-commerce website that sells clothing. When you search for a specific product, <br>

the website needs to generate a page that displays all the relevant information about that product, such as the price, size, and color options. <br>

With `server-side rendering`, the website can generate this page on the fly, using data from the server, without having to reload the entire page.<br>

In summary：

server-side rendering allows `websites to generate customized and dynamic content on the fly`, <br>

based on various factors such as user input or data from a database. <br>

`.ejs files are one way to implement server-side rendering`, allowing you to write code that generates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the server side.<br>
